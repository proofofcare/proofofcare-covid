The data is seperated into six regions. They are:

Fraser, Vancouver Coastal, Interior, Northern, Vancouver Island, Out of Canada

The main one we are interested in however is Vancouver Coastal as this is the region that includes the main city of Vancouver, Richmond and North Van.

The second most important is Fraser. This includes most of the lower mainland as well as populated areas such as Surrey and Burnaby



for data source, the spatial data source for GIS/data science set does not work. This gives a summary of the 5 regions in BC

the case data for csv works well but not sure how to interact with it

laboratory data gives testing data. for things like how many tests, positive tests and turn arounds
